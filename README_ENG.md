# REST API Documentation for the "PhotoShare" Application

    Introduction
The "PhotoShare" application allows users to upload, view, and comment on photos. The API is developed using the
FastAPI framework, ensuring fast and efficient handling of HTTP requests.

Authentication in the "PhotoShare" API is managed through tokens issued following successful user login.
The process involves the following steps:

    User Registration:
POST /users/register
Fields: username, password, email

    Photo Management
The application provides the ability to upload new photos, view existing ones, and delete them.
Each operation requires authentication.

Uploading a Photo:
POST /photos
The request must include multipart/form-data with the photo file.
Result: URL of the uploaded photo and information about it.
Viewing a Photo:

Deleting a Photo:

Commenting allows users to interact with photos through text comments.
